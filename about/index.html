                <p>We play games and have fun a lot, but several of us are interested in things like game development, coding/computer science, modding and more so if you like to build, tinker, study or socialize with likeminded people, then Goon X is for you.</p>

                <h1>Why Goon?</h1>
                <p>It started when Discord released guilds, I got lucky to own one and I thought it was funny having a "GOON" tag, and the X just comes from... Idk, it's funny. The server before that was Krill X if that explains it better lol. We do not actually promote degeneracy online and if you have a gooning problem, please seek help. This is all a hobby project started by <a href="https://goon.bio/chooger">Chooger</a> and helped by other server memembers. This is all just so I can learn, meet new people, teach people what I learn if they want to learn it too, and just have fun. And yes im aware my site isn't world class, the color scheme is my favorite colors and it's easy on my eyes so sorry if it renders weird or is ugly to you.</p>
